# Website making procedure

**Step1: Picking a HTML file**      

First pick any HTML file that you want.          
if you dont get a html file create a file        
named index.html and put this inside it
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Simple website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>This is a simple website</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

**Step2: Pushing to GitHub**    
Push the index.html file or the html file you pick to GitHub(To any repository). 

**Step3: Publishing the file**

Open the repository where you pushed the HTML file and open settings(On GitHub), and open pages.      
Scroll down until you see a menu named "None", and click on it and select "main".    
The moment you select main, another menu will popup right next to it.     
Click on that menu and select '/(root)', and click the save button.      
After clicking on save, scroll to the top and reload the page until see a url there.
If you see a url, that means that the HTML file has been published.
After you get a url, click to open it, and type the name of your html file(with extension) and click enter.   
After clicking enter, you will go to your website(Your website will be ready).
